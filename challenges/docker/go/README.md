# Full Cycle Docker Module 1

The main goal of this challenge was to create a simple Go app to print "Code.education Rocks!" and then publish a docker image with this app. However, the image must have 2MB or lower.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running

You can run this image in your computer:

```bash
docker run mcodex/codeeducation
```
